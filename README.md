### What I learned

My 4th Frontend Mentor Challenge. I expected to finish this project around 1H 30min, around the same time as my last challenge but, this one took me more than 2H. I learned quite a few things from this challenge;

- First is regarding the main content wrapper, I learned from my fellow developers in Frontend Master Discord that I should use `min-height: 100vh;` instead of `height: 100vh;`, as to not mess up my layout when the content is longer than the viewport height.

- Second is regarding the techniques used to analyzed the design and layout of the challenge. I learned that using tools PS, Adobe XD, etc. (I just used Paint, yes, it works) to analyze the width/height of the components is better than just using your eyes. Yes, pretty obvious but I didn't think of it before, I felt stupid for it.
