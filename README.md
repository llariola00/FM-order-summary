### What I learned

- This is my 3rd Frontend Mentor challenge. This one took me around 2H to complete. The hover icon overly effect was a bit tricky to get right. I was able to get the background color on hover effect easily, but the centering the icon was hard. `position: absolute;`, `top/bottom/left/right` and 'transform' CSS properties weren't working for me.

- I was able to center it using `d-flex;`, `justify-content-center;` and 'align-items-center' classes of bootstrap, and applying it to the parent container of the icon. I felt stupid for not thinking of using them in the first place.
